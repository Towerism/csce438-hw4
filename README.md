To Implement:  
master:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;currently has nothing for handling replication.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;currently cannot handle if a new server comes online  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least insofar as duplicating old files   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;currently cannot handle rebalancing connection points between servers
